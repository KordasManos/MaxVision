                <p>MaxVision Car Detail is a certified installer of premium Paint Protection Film (PPF), located in
                    Argyroupoli (Athens). This advanced film forms a durable, transparent layer over your car's paint,

                    up to 5 to 10 years, providing long-lasting protection far superior to traditional wax or sealants!

                <p>Installing PPF on your car comes with many benefits. Not only does it make maintenance easier, but it
                    also preserves the original paint, enhances shine, and ensures your vehicle maintains its fresh, new
                    look for years to come!</p>

                <h2>Does PPF Damage New Car Paint?</h2>
                <p>Installing PPF on your car comes with many benefits. Not only does it make maintenance easier, but it
                    also preserves the original paint, enhances shine, and ensures your vehicle maintains its fresh, new
                    look for years to come!</p>
                <p>This type of material is completely safe to apply to your new car. In fact, most paint protection
                    film customers opt to use this type of protective coating on the clear coat of vehicle’s paint vs a
                    ceramic coating, traditional carnauba wax, or paint sealants due to its safe application. For those
                    who are not aware, PPF is a thin, and uses a unique adhesive substance that bonds solidly to the
                    substrate.</p>
                <p> During the installation process, the clear paint protection film undergoes a multiple-stage
                    installation, where it is fitted, cut, placed, and then activated by a liquid spray. The installer
                    will use a squeegee to help apply the film to the painted surface. This is when the adhesive goes to
                    work to attach to the substrate.</p>
                <p> There are some vinyl materials or inferior quality protective films with cheap adhesives that will
                    become quite sticky if water penetrates the top coat. In fact, this is more common than you’d think
                    with vinyl wraps. But when it comes to a quality PPF like Ceramic Pro Kavaca Instant Healing Film,
                    you’re 100% safe.</p>

                <h2>The Advantages of Applying PPF on a New Car</h2>
                <p> If you’re going to invest in a paint protection film to keep your new vehicle’s paintjob and other
                    parts in mint condition, there are several advantages to consider.</p>
                <p><strong>Produces an enhanced finish.</strong> While some PPF’s might improve the shine of your
                    vehicle, Ceramic Pro
                    Kavaca is available in a gloss or matte finish. In fact, if you have a high gloss paintjob, you can
                    apply Kavaca Matte – to instantly create a brilliant and customized exterior look and appeal.</p>
                <p> <strong>Reduced orange peel and lack of glue marks.</strong> It’s common for some paint protection
                    films to leave
                    glue marks after the installation. Kavaca’s proprietary adhesive does not leave these marks or
                    creates an orange peel finish.</p>
                <p> <strong>Superior protection against chemicals and corrosion.</strong> Kavaca instant healing
                    protective films are
                    infused with four layers of material, each of them providing roadblocks for harmful contaminants or
                    chemicals to penetrate. It also provides superior stain resistance and reduces paint damage due to
                    stone chips.</p>
                <p> <strong>Instant healing of minor scratches.</strong> Most of the top brands of car paint protection
                    have self-healing
                    properties. This means, that minor scratches can be fixed by a detailer, simply by applying direct
                    heat – or with a blowing heat gun. Kavaca is the ONLY Instant Healing PPF on the market today. It
                    uses nano technology to fill minor scratches within a few seconds.</p>
                <p> <strong>High temperature resistance.</strong> This same nano-tech helps to provide a heat shield,
                    which blocks UV and
                    IR radiation from penetrating to the vehicles surface materials. This unique feature keeps
                    headlights from fogging or fading, which maintains your on-road visibility.</p>
                <p> <strong>A Limited Lifetime Warranty.</strong> Ceramic Pro and our network of more than 3,500
                    certified installers
                    take pride in providing superior customer service. We prove this by offering a limited lifetime
                    warranty on Kavaca Instant Healing PPF.</p>

                <h2>How long are you planning on keeping the vehicle?</h2>
                <p> If you typically trade in your vehicle every few years, and want to have the best trade-in value, a
                    PPF
                    installation on the front end is a great, cost-effective option to consider. If you want to keep the

                    coating.</p>
                <p>Paint protection films are exceptional products for keeping your car, truck, SUV, RV, motorcycle, or
                    commercial equipment looking factory fresh. And believe it or not, PPF is more affordable than you’d
                    assume – especially when you have a new vehicle that requires less paint correction or prep work.
                </p>
                <p> You’ve got the flexibility to select a PPF installation that is perfect for you. Whether you prefer
                    a
