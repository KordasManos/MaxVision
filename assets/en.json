    "pros_n_cons_p_2": "This type of material is completely safe to apply to your new car. In fact, most paint protection film customers opt to use this type of protective coating on the clear coat of vehicle’s paint vs a ceramic coating, traditional carnauba wax, or paint sealants due to its safe application. For those who are not aware, PPF is a thin, and uses a unique adhesive substance that bonds solidly to the substrate.",
    "pros_n_cons_p_3": "During the installation process, the clear paint protection film undergoes a multiple-stage installation, where it is fitted, cut, placed, and then activated by a liquid spray. The installer will use a squeegee to help apply the film to the painted surface. This is when the adhesive goes to work to attach to the substrate.",
    "pros_n_cons_p_4": "There are some vinyl materials or inferior quality protective films with cheap adhesives that will become quite sticky if water penetrates the top coat. In fact, this is more common than you’d think with vinyl wraps. But when it comes to a quality PPF like Ceramic Pro Kavaca Instant Healing Film, you’re 100% safe.",

    "pros_1_p_2": "<strong>Produces an enhanced finish.</strong> While some PPF’s might improve the shine of your vehicle, Ceramic Pro Kavaca is available in a gloss or matte finish. In fact, if you have a high gloss paintjob, you can apply Kavaca Matte – to instantly create a brilliant and customized exterior look and appeal.",
    "pros_1_p_3": "<strong>Reduced orange peel and lack of glue marks.</strong> It’s common for some paint protection films to leave glue marks after the installation. Kavaca’s proprietary adhesive does not leave these marks or creates an orange peel finish.",
    "pros_1_p_4": "<strong>Superior protection against chemicals and corrosion.</strong> Kavaca instant healing protective films are infused with four layers of material, each of them providing roadblocks for harmful contaminants or chemicals to penetrate. It also provides superior stain resistance and reduces paint damage due to stone chips.",
    "pros_1_p_5": "<strong>Instant healing of minor scratches.</strong> Most of the top brands of car paint protection have self-healing properties. This means, that minor scratches can be fixed by a detailer, simply by applying direct heat – or with a blowing heat gun. Kavaca is the ONLY Instant Healing PPF on the market today. It uses nano technology to fill minor scratches within a few seconds.",
    "pros_1_p_6": "<strong>High temperature resistance.</strong> This same nano-tech helps to provide a heat shield, which blocks UV and IR radiation from penetrating to the vehicles surface materials. This unique feature keeps headlights from fogging or fading, which maintains your on-road visibility.",
    "pros_1_p_7": "<strong>A Limited Lifetime Warranty.</strong> Ceramic Pro and our network of more than 3,500 certified installers take pride in providing superior customer service. We prove this by offering a limited lifetime warranty on Kavaca Instant Healing PPF.",
    "pros_2_header": "How long are you planning on keeping the vehicle?",
    "pros_2_p_1": "If you typically trade in your vehicle every few years, and want to have the best trade-in value, a PPF installation on the front end is a great, cost-effective option to consider. If you want to keep the vehicle for a long time, consider a full vehicle installation or a combination of PPF and nano ceramic coating.",
    "pros_2_p_2": "Paint protection films are exceptional products for keeping your car, truck, SUV, RV, motorcycle, or commercial equipment looking factory fresh. And believe it or not, PPF is more affordable than you’d assume – especially when you have a new vehicle that requires less paint correction or prep work.",
    "pros_2_p_3": "You’ve got the flexibility to select a PPF installation that is perfect for you.
